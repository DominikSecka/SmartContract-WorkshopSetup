# Alternative setup (local)

Note: This is not recommended!

You can use the ```bootstap.sh``` script in ```/provision-lubuntu``` to create the setup locally on your computer. This is completely without machine then.
If you wish you can also use the lubuntu base machine and create an alternative setup in vagrant for the ethdev machine. You can use the ```Vagrantfile``` in ```/provision-lubuntu``` to do so.
